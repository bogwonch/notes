With its exhilarating aroma and vivid flavour this is not your usual
lasagne â€“ instead of layers of egg pasta, here we use crunchy leaves
of chard, giving this dish the appearance of a beautifully wrapped
present. To me, herbs make up the personality traits of a dish. I like
to use sage and basil here, but you can personalise it with any herb
you fancy.

Serves 6:

- salted butter 50g
- leeks 500g, trimmed, cleaned and finely sliced
- basil leaves a handful, roughly chopped
- sage leaves a handful, roughly chopped
- salt and pepper
- chard 500g, trimmed and stalks separated
- eggs 3
- whipping cream 200ml
- carrot 1, cut into 5mm cubes
- celery stick 1, cut into 5mm cubes
- radishes 200g
  
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a very low heat, add the
leeks and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour, until the
leeks are soft, translucent and falling apart. Stir in the basil and
sage, season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat. Set aside.

Meanwhile, add the chard pieces to a large pan of salted boiling water
and blanch for 2-3 minutes. Drain and let dry between two clean tea
towels. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Dampen a sheet of baking
paper with a little water and use to line an 18cm springform cake tin.

In a bowl, beat the eggs together until light and fluffy. Add the
whipping cream and beat together until the mixture is slightly firm,
then season with salt and pepper and stir in the sauteed leeks along
with the carrot and celery pieces.

Arrange the dried chard pieces, reserving a handful, in an overlapping
pattern to cover the base and sides of the prepared cake tin.

Fill the tin with the cream and vegetable mixture, then cover with the
remaining leaves, folding the overhanging leaves towards the middle
like a parcel to enclose the filling. Loosely cover the tortino with
baking paper, and cook in the oven for 40 minutes until the filling
has set firm.

Remove the tortino from the oven and gently flip it over, removing the
baking paper. Using a mandoline or sharp knife, cut the radishes into
thin slices and use to decorate the top of the tortino. Serve hot or
cold.
