  We love making Moroccan inspired dishes at our home, those fragrant pungent
  spices, meltingly tender meat, the combination of the sweet and savoury
  flavours makes authentic food from this region a comfort and joy to eat.
  This dish always transports me to a different place, admist the mechoiu,
  bustling streets, smells of spices in the air and wafts of Moroccan
  eateries lingering in the streets. Its easy enough to make at home, great
  for a sharing supper.

  Serves: 3-4:

  - 400g/14.1 oz Stewing Lamb (cut into pieces)
  - 1 tablespoon butter/smen
  - 1 teaspoon cumin

  Preheat oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Place the lamb pieces in a bag, rub into
  it the butter, then sprinkle over your cumin and coriander. Add your salt,
  thyme along with the rosemary, 2 tablespoons of harissa and a few good
  pinches of pepper.

  Smash the garlic cloves and put them into the bag, make sure all the meat is
  covered well with the marinade.

  In a casserole dish, add 2 tablepoons of olive oil, put all the meat into the
  dish and sear till slightly brown, take out and set aside. Then fry the
  onions till softened, return the meat back to the dish, stir and mix well.
  Add in enough water to just about cover the meat.

  Cover and place into the oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour or until when fored,
  meat gently falls off the bone.

  While this is cooking, make your flatbreads, in a bowl mix the flour with the
  baking powder and sumac or chilli or any other spices. Then add the
  yoghurt, knead well till a dough is formed on a lightly floured surface.
  Divide into balls, depending on how many you want, warm up a saucepan with
  a dadh of oil, then place on for a couple of minutes each side till
  slightly golden.

  Serve on a plate with the harissa lamb pieces on top,sprinkle with
  pomegranate seeds, add a dollop of yoghurt on the side and spoonful of
