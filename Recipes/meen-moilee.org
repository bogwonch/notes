Meen moilee—fish in fragrant coconut milk—is one of Kerala’s
better-known seafood curries. This family recipe has a hint of
tartness and is a relatively easy one-pot evening meal. Serve with
boiled rosematta or other short-grain rice.

Makes 4 servings:

- 2 t turmeric, divided
- 1/2 t cayenne pepper
- 1t fresh lime juice
- + vegetable oil
- 1 lb king mackerel steaks
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 1-inch stick cinnamon
- 2 cloves
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 1/2-inch piece ginger, thinly sliced
- 3-4 fresh green chilies, halved lengthwise
- 8-10 curry leaves, plus more for garnish
- + salt
- 2 C coconut milk, divided
- 1 t freshly ground black pepper

Stir together 1 teaspoon turmeric, the cayenne pepper, and the lime
juice. Marinate steaks in mixture for at least 30 minutes.

Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a medium saucepan. Sear the steaks
on both sides, then remove from pan. Add another 3 tablespoons oil,
then the cinnamon, cloves, and curry leaves. Sauté until fragrant, 1–2
minutes. Add the onions, ginger, garlic, and green chilies. Sauté on
medium heat until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Season
with remaining turmeric and a pinch of salt.

Add 1 3/4 cup coconut milk and bring to a boil over a low heat,
stirring to incorporate seasonings. Return fish to gravy, reduce heat,
and let simmer until fish is cooked, about 5 minutes, turning
once. Season with black pepper and remove from heat.

Prior to serving, stir in reserved 1/4 cup coconut milk and garnish
