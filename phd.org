*** Reviewers comments
**** Reviewer 1
     This paper provides an evalation of five different BYOD policies. The
     evaluation is performed on an encoding of the policies in to SecPAL,
     the translation of which was done by the authors. The key contribution
     of the paper is to report statistics on different types of predicates
     that are contained within the policies. The take away is that the
     policies cover a diverse set of concerns and approaches for addressing
     those concerns.

     BYOD is a continual security concern for IT administrators, and it is
     valuable to understand how those security concerns are addressed in
     practice. The paper provides a valuable investigation of different BYOD
     policies that might be adopted by hospitals and enterprises.

     My main concern with the paper is that it is not clear how the authors
     resolved ambiguity in the BYOD policies when translating into SecPAL.
     The absence of ambiguity is the motivation for using SecPAL, but the
     only statement the authors make is in the conclusion: "The translation
     from natural to formal language is somewhat subjective. We have tried to
     mitigate this by attempting to preserve the style of the original and by
     careful use of predicates between different policies." Did the authors
     work together. What happened when ambiguity was encountered. Did you try
     to contact the writers of the policies? Can you give some examples of
     where ambiguity occurred?

     Section III discusses policies for "company-owned phones". This means
     the phone is not a BYOD device. The paper needs to be more clear about
     the implications of this, and potentially remove these rules from the
     evaluated dataset.

     The paper could do a much better job at distilling the main lessons and
     take-aways.

     Summary:

     Authors look at five BYOD policies: two hypothetical policies provided as
     guidelines, one from a hospital, one from a company, and one from a university.
     These policies are translated into a formal language and then analyzed and
     compared.

     Comments:

     * I was not able to find [6] which is by the same authors. It appears that
       that paper addressed the issue of lifting the formal language from the
       policies and this short paper begins to compare different BYOD policies.
     * The comparison of BYOD policies to MDM tool capabilities is interesting --
       the language of BYOD policies exceeds what MDM tools can currently
       implement. Adding acknowledgements to mobile devices seems difficult, do the
       authors have any sense whether these acknowledgements are required on every
       action or just once?
     * The difficulty in translating BYOD policies to SecPAL is briefly mentioned
       in the conclusion. It would be useful to ellaborate on how much of this was
       done manually when the tools failed.

     Minor Comments:

     * "Some of these concerns (the use of acknowledgements in particular) are not
       addressed by current BYOD tools." -- Should be "MDM".

* Third Year Review
** <2017-02-13 9:30 Mon> Third year review with David, Myrto and Bjorn

   - “It’s too late to fire you so I guess you’d better get a PhD.” — David Aspinall

   - Need to get an overarching narative for thesis.  Story with BYOD is good but I need to do a much better job of selling it/myself.
   - Chapter a month for review seems reasonable; David slightly worried its slipping but Myrto and Bjorn seemed confident.
   - I have enough work.
   - David thinks I should probably be elligible for some extension even if Bob Fisher (admin who sent snotty email).
     - Have emphasised that I want to finish on time, because baby and work requirements.
     - But perhaps some extra funding?
   - I need to stop underselling myself.
     - My work is good and interesting.
   - Add section to MDM chapter about how I would integrate AppPAL with an MDM package to implement a policy.
   - Talk to MDM author…
     - Maybe just Kami?
