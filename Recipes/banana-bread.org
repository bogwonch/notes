The perfect way to use up three or four overripe bananas is in this tea bread.
Made with baking powder and oil instead of butter, it is very quick to put
together.

Ingredients:

- 3-4 ripe medium bananas, mashed
- 3 medium eggs, beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 190ml sunflower oil
- 125g wholemeal flour
- 125g plain flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 115g soft brow sugar
- 60g chopped walnuts (or sultanas)

Mix the wet ingredients then the dry ingredients, then the sultanas.

Pour into (900g/2lb) loaf tin (a normal sized one), and bake at 160℃ for 55-65
mins, until a spear comes out clean.

Cool on a rack.
