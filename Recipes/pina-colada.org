It was on August 15, 1954, that Ramon "Monchito" Marrero Perez first introduced
the Pina Colada to the customers of the Beachcomber Bar at the Caribe Hilton in
San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is said that he spent three months working on it until
he finally felt he had captured "the sunny, tropical flavor of Puerto Rico in a
glass."

- 2 oz white rum
- 1 oz Coco Lopez Coconut Cream
- 1 oz heavy cream
- 6 oz pineapple juice
- 4-6 oz ice

Blend all ingredients in a blender. Garnish with a speared cherry and pineapple
chunk.
