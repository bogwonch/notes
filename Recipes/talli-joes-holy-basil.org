This effervescent south Indian sundowner uses masala chai, a
spice-flavoured tea you can buy in most supermarkets. Serves one.

- 4 fresh basil leaves
- 60ml whisky (we use Chivas Regal)
- 50ml masala tea, chilled
- 50ml grapefruit syrup (made 1:1 sugar with grapefruit juice)
- 10ml fresh lime juice
- Prosecco to finish
- 1 sprig fresh basil and 1 slice grapefruit, to garnish

Muddle (ie, bash) the basil in a cocktail shaker, add the whisky, tea,
syrup and lime, and shake over ice. Strain into a chilled wine glass
over ice, top with prosecco, and garnish.
