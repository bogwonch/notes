** Suya Spice Mix                                  :spice:vegetarian:ghanian:

This will determine the heat of your dish. If you like spicy food, go
with the below. For something milder, reduce or omit the ground hot
pepper.

Makes around 200g:

- 150–200g peanuts, ground and roasted
- 2 tsp ground hot or cayenne pepper
- ½ tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- ½ tsp ground cloves
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp salt

Optional extra seasonings:

- 2 tbsp groundnut or sunflower oil 
- 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated
- 5cm piece of fresh ginger, finely grated 
- A sprig of thyme, leaves picked
- 1 tbsp lime juice

Mix all the ingredients for the spice mix together in a bowl. Transfer
to an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Store for up to one
month. If you’ve added fresh ingredients, store in the fridge and use
it within a week.

** Chichinga (suya beef kebabs)                          :beef:spicy:ghanian:

The leaner your meat, the better, so trim any sinew away. I recommend
tenderising the diced beef by gently bashing it with a rolling
pin. Many vegetables work, like aubergines and courgettes; AnyThe
cubes will flatten out and will cook faster on the grill. I like to
use mixed bell peppers here, because they are cheap, easy, and the
red, yellow and green colours echo the Ghanaian flag! Courgettes and
aubergine work really well too.

Serves 4-6:

- 3-4 tbsp suya spice mix
- 3 tbsp rapeseed or groundnut oil, plus extra for brushing
- 1kg lean beef rump, trimmed and cubed
- 2-3 bell peppers, cored, deseeded and cut into chunks 
- 1 red onion, cut into quarters and separated
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper

For a side salad (optional):

- Fresh seasonal salad leaves
- 2-3 tbsp roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped 
- A small pinch of ground chilli powder
- A few coriander leaves

Mix the dry spice mix with the rapeseed oil in a bowl. Add the diced
beef to the bowl and massage the mixure thoroughly into the
meat. Thread the chunks of pepper, onion and beef on to your skewers –
I use 10–13cm bamboo skewers.

As ever, the longer you can leave the ingredients to marinate the
better, so if you have time, lay the skewers in a dish, cover with
clingfilm and leave in the fridge for at least 1-2 hours, but
preferably overnight if you’re organised and have planned ahead.

Take the skewers out of the fridge and leave them to sit at room
temperature for a few minutes while you prepare a charcoal
barbecue. Alternatively, preheat a gas barbecue, griddle pan or grill
to a medium-high heat. Brush the meat with groundnut oil and season
with the salt and pepper before adding to the barbecue or griddle pan
or putting under the grill.

The kebabs should sizzle as they hit the grill or griddle, but don’t
move them too quickly. Turn them over after 2-3 minutes for medium
rare, or give them 3-4 minutes each side for well done (depending on
the size of the beef chunks used).

Remove from the heat and leave to rest for 2-3 minutes. If you like,
serve with theside salad above.

** Mango and Pineapple Salad                                  :salad:ghanian:
Ghanaians aren’t big on salads, but we do have plenty of wonderful
fresh ingredients, so there’s every opportunity to get inventive
within the Ghanaian tradition.

Serves 4:

- Juice of 1 lemon
- 50ml orange juice
- 25ml apple juice
- 2 ripe mangoes, cubed
- Half a fresh pineapple, cubed
- Half a cucumber 
- 200-250g rocket leaves, washed and drained
- 50g cashews, crushed or whole
- Salt

Mix the juices together and add to a bowl with the pineapple and
mango.

Halve the cucumber lengthways, de-seed using a teaspoon and slice into
whatever shapes you prefer – I like simple half-moons.

Remove the fruit chunks from the bowl (reserve the excess juices to
drizzle later) and gently add to another bowl with the rocket and
cucumber.

To finish, drizzle a little juice over the salad, add a pinch of sea
salt, and garnish with crushed cashews.
