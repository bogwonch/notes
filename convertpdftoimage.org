* How do I convert a PDF to a series of images?

Where density is the DPI, and quality is 100% (i.e. no down scaling)
Files will be called =outfile_1.jpg= and so on.  You probably want to extract to its own folder.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
function pdf-to-jpegs() {
    local infile="${1?input file}"
    local outfile="$(basename "${infile}" .pdf).jpeg"
    local outdir="$(basename "${infile}")"
    
    mkdir "${outdir}"
    convert -density 600 "${infile}" -quality 100 "${outdir}/${outfile}"
}
#+END_SRC
