Notes:

The Pork – many cuts of pork can be used to make Char Siu. For the
most tender, juicy and fattiest version, use pork belly without the
skin. If you prefer a good balance between meat and tenderness, use
pork butt or pork neck. For the lean version, use pork loin. I don’t
really use pork loin because it has zero fat and as we all know fat is
flavor:) For this particular recipe, I use a piece of well-marbled
pork butt.

The BBQ Sauce – many restaurants claim to have developed their highly
regarded secret BBQ recipes. However, almost every recipe involves the
below three Chinese sauces. So it’s essential to use all three of
them: Ground Bean Sauce, Hoisin Sauce, and Oyster Sauce.

The Glaze – contrary to the common believe, the famous finger-licking
sticky glaze on Char Siu is often created by using maltose instead of
honey. Since I don’t usual keep maltose in my pantry I just use honey
which makes an even better glaze.

- Yield: 4 servings
- Prep Time: 1 day 
- Cook Time: 60 minutes

Ingredients:

- 2lb pork butt
- 2tbsp soy sauce
- 1tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1.5tbsp ground bean sauce
- 1.5tbsp oyster sauce
- 2tbsp hoisin sauce
- 4tbsp Chinese cooking wine (rose flavored wine preferred)
- 1tbsp sugar
- ½tbsp kosher salt or 1/3 tbsp table salt
- 1tsp five spice powder
- 1tsp garlic powder
- 1 star anise (optional)
- 1 bay leaf (optional)

Honey Glaze

- 4tbsp honey
- 1tbsp sugar
- 3tbsp water

Slice the pork along the grain to ½ inch thick slices. Thinner slice
makes it easier for the flavor to penetrate. To get the best flavor
and texture, brine the pork in salt water over night before adding the
marinade

Make the BBQ sauce by combining all the sauce ingredients in a small
pot. Cook over low heat while mixing until the sauce is smooth. About
3 minutes. Set aside to cool. This can be done in advance

Pour the BBQ sauce over the sliced pork. Make sure that you turn the
pork over so that all sides are coated with the marinade. You can also
marinate the pork in a sealed Ziploc bag. Keep the pork in the fridge
for 12 to 24 hours

You can roast the pork on an outdoor grill or an oven. To roast the
pork in an oven, first preheat the oven to 375 F or 190 C. Brush off
the extra BBQ sauce on the pork and place the pork on a grilling rack
with a tray beneath to capture the dripping. Do not place the meat
directly on a tray. Roast the pork for 20 minutes on each side. Save
the leftover pork marinade

While the pork is roasting/grilling, combine the glaze ingredients in
a small pot and heat over low heat while mixing. Keep stirring until
the honey, water, and sugar are well incorporated. About 2
minutes. Turn off the heat. The glaze should be a running sticky paste

Take the pork out after 40 minutes of roasting or grilling. Generously
pour the glaze over top of the pork and let it run down. Make sure all
sides of the pork are coated with the glaze. Brush off the excess
glaze if necessary

Set the oven to 425 F or 219 C and place the pork back to the
oven. Roast for another 5 minutes on each side or until the pork is
slightly charred. Take out the pork and let it cool a little bit

Lastly, in a pot, combine a few tbsp of water, pork marinade leftover,
and any dripping collected. Bring to boil. Add soy sauce and sugar to
taste. This will be the au jus used for serving the pork.



* Char Siu Bao (叉烧包)                       :dimsum:cantonese:chinese:buns:

For the dough:

- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- ¾ cup warm water
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup cornstarch
- 5 tablespoons sugar
- 1/4 cup canola or vegetable oil
- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

For the filling:

- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1/3 cup finely chopped shallots or red onion
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
- 1 1/2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons dark soy sauce
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 1/2 cup[s diced [[Char Siu (叉燒)]]

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment
(you can also just use a regular mixing bowl and knead by hand),
dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Sift together the flour and
cornstarch, and add it to the yeast mixture along with the sugar and
oil. Turn on the mixer to the lowest setting and let it go until a
smooth dough ball is formed. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest
for 2 hours. (I haven't forgotten about the baking powder. You'll add
that later!)

While the dough is resting, make the meat filling. Heat the oil in a
wok over medium high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for a
minute. Turn heat down to medium-low, and add the sugar, soy sauce,
oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until the
mixture starts to bubble up. Add the chicken stock and flour, cooking
for a couple minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in
the roast pork. Set aside to cool. If you make the filling ahead of
time, cover and refrigerate to prevent it from drying out.

After your dough has rested for 2 hours, add the baking powder to the
dough and turn the mixer on to the lowest setting. At this point, if
the dough looks dry or you're having trouble incorporating the baking
powder, add 1-2 teaspoons water. Gently knead the dough until it
becomes smooth again. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for
another 15 minutes. In the meantime, get a large piece of parchment
paper and cut it into ten 4x4 inch squares. Prepare your steamer by
bringing the water to a boil.

Now we are ready to assemble the buns: roll the dough into a long tube
and divide it into 10 equal pieces. Press each piece of dough into a
disc about 4 1/2 inches in diameter (it should be thicker in the
center and thinner around the edges). Add some filling and pleat the
buns until they're closed on top.

Place each bun on a parchment paper square, and steam. I steamed the
buns in two separate batches using a bamboo steamer (be sure the
boiling water does not touch the buns during steaming process). Once
the water boils, place the buns in the steamer and steam each batch
for 12 minutes over high heat.
