* MDM demos

* MDM Vendors
- [[http://enterpriseios.com/wiki/Comparison_MDM_Providers][Comparison of MDM Providers]]
  - A good source of information about different MDM software.
  - Seems a little dated but a good first start

- [[https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-391HFY8&ct=160608&st=sb][Report on MDM vendors they all seem to cite]]
  - [[./gartner-magic-quadrant.png]]
    - Everyone is either a /Leader/, /Visionary/ or /Niche Player/.
    - Some interesting material that explains basic terms, but a *lot* of gobbledygook.

** Mobile Device Management for Office 365

[[https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Capabilities-of-built-in-Mobile-Device-Management-for-Office-365-a1da44e5-7475-4992-be91-9ccec25905b0?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US][Source]]

- Microsoft's MDM software
- Supports Android 4+, iOS 7+ and Windows and Windows Phone

- Access Control for Office 365 documents
  - Can require encryption, certain security settings, test for jailbroken devices, and check for a managed email profile.
  - Policies limited to simple box ticking
    - i.e. block screen capture can be on or off

- Remote wipe capability

** Microsoft Intune

[[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune][Source]]

A more advanced version of [[Mobile Device Management for Office 365]] which provides /Mobile Application Management/.
Designed to run in Microsoft's apps, and avoid users having to install provisioning profiles (which they dislike).o

*** Policy CSP

[[https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn904962(v=vs.85).aspx][Source]]

- Uses the same same policy language as Windows 10.
- But still essentially a box-ticking system
  - Fields can have values but no real delegation or declarative policies for who can update them.

** MobileIron

- Have a [[https://www.mobileiron.com/en/video/visual-privacy][Visual Privacy]] feature to alert user's what the MDM software can or cannot do.
  - Very similar to Android's old permission notifications

- Seems to be primarily focused on provisioning every aspect of a device (i.e. email, VPN, office)

- Policies are configured on top of MobileIron Core
  - [[https://www.mobileiron.com/en/resources/faq#policies-and-how-to-use][Policies can be applied.]] (???)

  - Policies can select apps, and configure them seemingly through App Wrapping
    - [[https://www.mobileiron.com/en/products/appconnect][Source]]
    - Some network configuration (per app VPNs/Tunnelling)
    - Some web app configuration via PhoneGap
    - Some security controls
  
  - They don't say it explicitly, but it seems this is all tick-box stuff again.

      
** Amtel NetPlus>>>Mobility

- Got a certificate error on accessing their website.
- Looks dead 
  - last twitter post April 2015
  - website updated in 2014?

[[http://www.amtelnet.com/solutions/mobile-security/byod-security/][Source]]

- Download links don't work on their website
- Some usual tick box security things
- Location based security
  - Allows policy to only be enforced in geofenced area

[[http://www.amtelnet.com/solutions/mobile-security/mobile-apps-management/][Source]]

- Some app management features, wrapping the device's app store
- Enterprise app store
  - Apps with access control policies
  - Black/White lists of public apps
** Citrix XenMobile

[[https://www.citrix.com/products/xenmobile/compare.html][Source]]

Can't really see what it does, but it looks like a provisioning tool.

[[https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/products-solutions/xenapp-xnedesktop-and-xenmobile-integration-for-a-comprehensive-mobility-solution.pdf][Source]]

- Mostly just app installation
- Enterprise app store (but looks like you pick the apps).
- Per-app dedicated micro-VPN for data separation
  - App wrapping then?
 

** IBM MaaS360

- They *really* want you to be able to chat directly with them.
  - Fine let's chat with Keith!

  - Keith is unusually helpful.
    - Is going to ask engineers for more information about their policies and semantics
    - Mostly this is something for companies to just install and run.
      - They might let you have the code to build something on top of this, but that'd be an unusual exception.

    - Chief competitors are [[MobileIron]] and [[VMware AirWatch]].
      - Most products are much of a muchness, but there may be some small vendors doing more advanced things.
      - At the moment limited by how much access manufacturers like Samsung give them.
      - Market is completely flooded.

[[http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/maas360-mobile-application-management][Source]]

- Has a curated app store
  - Looks like a store for IBM apps and some selected ones?
  - Keith confirms white and black list only
  - Pre-canned policies

- Some monioring as well, and configuration management.  
- Can do containerization.

- Keith confirms, not capable of declarative policies.
 
** VMware AirWatch

[[http://www.air-watch.com/solutions/bring-your-own-device-byod/][Source]]

- Can run only on certain configurable devices (white/black list)
- Configuration and enterprise login.
- Can customize Terms of Use based on whose device you're provisioning.
- Remote wipe, and can delete certain apps on an employees departure

- Can separate employee and personal data, with containers.
- Some form of /compliance engine/ that monitors the devices for violations and locks the user out if they're detected
  - Video seems to suggest it can tell the user what they need to do to get back to being compliant.
