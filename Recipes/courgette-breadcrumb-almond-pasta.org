This recipe also works brilliantly with marrow.
Supposed to be with Sicillian courgettes or marrows, but lets ignore that.

- Serves 4

- 4 courgettes or a long cucuzza
- 1-2 fat cloves of garlic
- A pinch of red chilli flakes
- 6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- Salt
- 500g pasta
- A handful of dry breadcrumbs
- 50g blanched almonds, roughly chopped

Trim the courgettes, cut them in quarters lengthways and chop into small, even
pieces. (If you are using cucuzza, you will need to peel them first). Peel the
garlic, then either press it gently with the back of a knife or, for a stronger
flavour, chop it.

In a large, deep pan, fry the garlic and chilli in 4 tbsp oil until the garlic
is lightly golden and fragrant – you can now remove it if you like. Add the
courgette (or cucuzza, or marrow) and add a pinch of salt, then stir so each
piece is coated with oil and fry gently for a few more minutes. Add a small
glass of water to the pan, then let the courgettes simmer until very soft and
most of the water has gone. If they are ready before the pasta, pull the pan to
one side.

Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water to the boil, add salt, stir. Add the
pasta, then cook until al dente – around 8 minutes.

Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in another small pan, add the breadcrumbs, almonds and
a pinch of salt. Fry, shaking the pan, until just golden and toasty, then remove
from the heat.

Once the pasta is ready, drain or use a slotted spoon to lift it directly from
the water on to the courgettes. Stir, divide between bowls, then top with
crumbs.


** Notes

Recipe seems to want them in chunks but ribbons might also be nice.

Might be good with farfelle (chunks), pic seems to suggest farfelle but
bucattini/spaghetti worked well before.
