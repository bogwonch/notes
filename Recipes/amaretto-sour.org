No, really. I’m serious. In case you think I’m joking, or that you read that
wrong, let me go on the record right now:

I make the best Amaretto Sour you’ve ever had in your life. No ifs, ands or buts
about it, my Amaretto Sour dominates and crushes all others out there. And now,
I’m going to share my secrets with you.

There are two things that impede all other Amaretto Sours from challenging mine.
First off, the obvious: they’re too sweet. One does not simply use an everyday
sour recipe to make a world-class Amaretto Sour, it must be adjusted for this
particular liqueur.

Second, and this is a big one: amaretto isn’t strong enough on its own to stand
up to a bunch of other ingredients. It’s weak. It needs help. And for this, I
enlist the assistance of an old friend. One that knows amaretto’s strengths and
weaknesses. Or, mainly, its weaknesses. One that works with amaretto, to
complete it like Jerry Maguire completes Rene Zellwiger’s character, whatever
her name was. And that, my friends, is cask-proof bourbon.

Ingredients:

- 1½ oz amaretto (I love the Lazzaroni amaretto, but DiSaronno works well here, too)
- ¾ oz cask-proof bourbon (I use Booker’s, from the Jim Beam distillery)
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 tsp. 2:1 simple syrup
- ½ oz egg white, beaten

Dry shake ingredients to combine, then shake well with cracked ice. Strain over
fresh ice in an old fashioned glass. Garnish with lemon peel and brandied
cherries, if desired. Serve and grin like an idiot as your friends freak out.
