** Case Study

- We have policies written up for:
  - NHS
  - SANS
  - Some other junk ones
- Open questions
  - How do we know the AppPAL formalization is correct
    - We don’t but it doesn¡Çt actually matter.
      AppPAL acts as a tool for reasoning and modelling policies
      It helps us spot when there may be mistakes and when we need to check our assumptions.
  - Linting
    - Consistency
      - Do you have two AppPAL statements that say opposite things that are both true
      - We have a plan for how to do it but needs schemas for AppPAL
      - Plan actually needs testing and more thought
      - …and actual implementation
    - Completeness
      - Do we have enough information to make a decision
      - Sorta implemented :-D
      - Needs testing and understanding when it gets decision wrong
    - Redundancy
      - How can you spot when a branch of choices will never be made, or when multiple statements are checked multiple times
      - Suspect this is the hardest
